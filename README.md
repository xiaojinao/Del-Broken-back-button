# Del-Broken-back-button
My backspace key is broken, and I’m using this program to remap it to the ‘Delete’ key or another key as a replacement.

First off, make sure you’ve got PyInstaller installed on your computer. If it’s not on there yet, you can sort that out by running
```pip install pyinstaller```   in the terminal. 

``` pip install pyinstaller ```
